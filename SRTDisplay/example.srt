In this tutorial I will show you how to evaluate the step response

1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,640
of an RC circuit using standard circuit techniques

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,940
Now by step response what we mean is that the voltage
or current applied to the circuit involves a jump

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,050
As you can see in this case our voltage source
initially is off before time "t" equal to 0 
and jumps up to 12 volts at time t equal to zero.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,640
We want to do in this case is evaluate the current through the
capacitor and at the same time 

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,380
we'll also evaluate the voltage which is both the voltage on the capacitor and the voltage across the three kilo ohm resistor 

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,760
now the key thing to remember about step response evaluation is that
we need to evaluate the time constant

15
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,949
initial and final values. Now each value

16
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,309
so the time constant we denote by tau and  tau

17
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:02,460
represents the value we'll see when we have this decaying exponential

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,860
e to the minus t over tau

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,060
response. In a circuit like the one
we're looking at, the voltages and currents

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,530
all experience the same time constant. The basic explanation for this is that

22
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,830
if you would imagine the

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,170
voltages on the six kilo ohm resistor and the three-kilo ohm resistor

24
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,950
they have to add up to a flat  value, so whatever

25
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,210
e to the minus t over tau  shape one as the other one also has to have the same shape

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,880
the same thing happened at the node when we are evaluating KCL
